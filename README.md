## project-x-nba-comparison

## Overview
I wanted to experiment with the data visualisation library Recharts.js so I created this simple web application that lets the user compare and chart the stats of two NBA players.

The API's Documentation can be found here: https://www.balldontlie.io/#getting-started

You can launch the site on [GitHub Pages](https://cmtran09.github.io/project-2-potterapi-pair/), or check out the [Repo](https://github.com/cmtran09/project-2-potterapi-pair).

If you will like to download this repository and run it locally, run the following in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/cmtran09/project-2-potterapi-pair.git
```

Next run:
```
yarn
```
Finally, to run on your brower via localhost:8000
```
yarn serve
```
